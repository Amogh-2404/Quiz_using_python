## Introduction

Quiz_in_python is a Python project that lets you play a quiz game right in your terminal. It's a great way to learn and practice Python programming while having fun with quizzes.

## Project Files

The project consists of four Python files:

1. **main.py**: This is the main entry point for the game. It imports questions, creates a quiz bank, and initiates the quiz.

2. **question_model.py**: This file defines the `Question` class, which represents a quiz question. It takes the question text and answer as parameters.

3. **data.py**: This file contains the list of quiz questions and their corresponding answers in the `question_data` list.

4. **quiz_brain.py**: This file defines the `QuizBrain` class, which handles the quiz logic, keeps track of the score, and checks user answers.

## How to Play

To play the quiz game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `main.py` file using Python:  
   `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` if you are using python version 3 and above.
    1. Answer each quiz question by typing "True" or "False" (case-insensitive) and press Enter.
    2. After answering all questions, your final score will be displayed.
